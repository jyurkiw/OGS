# Rolling and Dice

This game system uses the following polyhedral dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12.

This game system uses the following dice terms:

**Roll**: To roll the die and total their values.

**Total**: The total value of a roll calculated by adding up their individual values.

**Die**: Used to refer to a single die. If an effect states that it affects a die it only affects a single die no matter how many dice are in the roll or the affected pool. Dice pools can be targeted by an effect that states it can target a die, in which case the effect's controller can pick which die in the pool is affected.

**Dice Pool**: Used to refer to multiple dice rolled as a group and added together. If an effect states that it affects a die pool, it will only affect a single pool even if a roll consists of multiple pools.

**Die Increase**: An effect that increases the size of a target die. Valid targets only include Action Checks and Enhancement Dice by default, but others may be specified in the effect description.

There are three kinds of rolls in the OGS. The first is the most common kind and is called an Action Check. Action checks are a small number of dice rolled, modified, and added together with the total compared to a difficulty set by the GM. If the total is equal to or greater than the difficulty the action succeeds, and if the total is less than the difficulty the action fails.

All Action Checks are comprised of two dice and a dice pool. The first die is the stat die appropriate for the kind of action being taken. The second die is either the skill or force die depending on what, exactly, the roll is (generally, if a player is trying to do something, the check will use a skill of some kind). Finally, the dice pool is generally referred to as the Enhancement Die and will usually be a single die or maybe a die and some kind of modifier (for example, a common enhancement modifier will be to reroll ones). However, some powerful modifiers will add multiple dice allowing a character to roll an action with four or more dice being totaled (a common example of this is the strength and body modifiers granted to particularly large creatures. A strength check made by a giant or a dragon can be made with six dice or more).

The second kind of roll in the OGS is the Opposed Check. When the GM calls for an Opposed Check the player and the GM (or the two players) both make appropriate Action Checks, as adjudicated by the GM, and compare their totals. The participant with the higher total wins the Opposed Check. It is possible for multiple participants to roll the same total, in which case the resulting tie is broken by comparing the following factors: Individual die values from largest to smallest, individual die sizes from largest to smallest, and finally by repeatedly rolling opposed d12s to see who rolls highest.

**Example**: The GM tells Michael to roll an Opposed Check to sneak past a city guardsman without being discovered. Michael rolls his Coordination of d4, plus his Sneak skill of d8, plus his Quiet Footpad general enhancement of d8 and gets a 1, 4, and 6 for a total of 11. The GM rolls the guardsman's Notice skill check of 3d6 and also rolls a 1, a 4, and a 6 for a total of 11.

Because their totals are equal they tie and the GM compares their individual dice to determine how to break the tie. The guard's highest roll is a 6, and Michael's highest roll is also a 6. The guardsman's next highest is a 4 and so is Michael's, and it goes the same for their matching 1s. If they had not both rolled exactly the same the tie would have been broken in favor of whomever had the highest die in any of the three comparisons.

Next the GM compares the die sizes. The guard rolled 3d6 so all three dice have six sides. However, Michael has a d8 for his first size comparison and so the tie is broken in Michael's favor. The guard does not notice him.

If one of Michael's d8s had come up seven or eight, he would have won the tie breaker when the die values were compared. And if he had rolled a two instead of a one his total would have been 12; enough to beat the guard's total by one.

The third kind of roll in the OGS is an Open Roll. This is just a term used to describe any roll that isn't a check and can be comprised of any combination of dice. All Open Rolls are simply totaled and the total value is used in some way directly. Rolling for damage after successfully attacking a target is an example of an open roll.

# Totals and Degrees of Success

Action can sometimes not just succeed. Sometimes a character rolls so well they succeed _and then some_. If an Action Check's total exceeds the target difficulty by two or more it is considered to be a critical success. Every additional two the difficulty is exceeded by adds another level of critical success. The multiple levels of critical success are referred to as "Stages". So, for example, if a character tried to attack a monster, and that attack had a difficulty of 8, and then the attacking character rolled a 16 you would say that the character got a "Four Stage Critical Success" or "Four Stage Critical Hit".

Contrary to critical success there is no such thing as a critical failure, no matter how low the total comes up, unless optional critical failure rules are used.

Actions generally determine the outcome of critical successes on a case by cause basis, if there are any effects at all. A Sneak skill check, for example, doesn't benefit from critical success. Attack rolls, on the other hand, benefit greatly with every stage adding another die to the damage roll.

# Flat Bonuses

The rarest kind of bonus in the OGS is the flat bonus. They are usually reserved for the effects of magic spells and magic items, and are extraordenarly powerful. In the case where a character with an applicable flat bonus rolls an Action Check or an Open Roll the flat bonus is added directly to the total.

# Increasing Die Sizes

Many modifiers increase die size including Enhancements and mystical effects. This effect is called a Die Increase and is represented in stages. A 1-Stage Die Increase increases a die one size, for example from d4 to d6. A 2-Stage Die Increase will increase a die two sizes, for example from d4 to d8.

Die Increase effects can normally only affect Action Checks, and will affect the enhancement die unless a different target is explicitly described in the effect description. In the rare instances where a Die Increase effect targets an open roll, *all* dice are increased. For example, if a 7th level Fireball spell that normally deals 10d6 points of fire damage is affected by a 2-Stage Die Increase effect, it will instead deal 10d10 points of fire damage.

If a Die Increase effect pushes a die above d12 the following occurs.

* If a die is affected, it becomes a dice pool
* The die pool defaults to [d8 + d6]
* Any further Die Increase effects from the same effect (example: a multi-stage Die Increase) target the d6 by default. A new effect can choose to target either die
