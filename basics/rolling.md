# Rolling and Dice

This game system uses the following polyhedral dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12.

## Action Checks
There are three kinds of rolls in the OGS. The first is the most common kind and is called an Action Check. All action checks are generally comprised of three dice:

* A stat die.
* A skill die.
* A modifier die.

When an Action Check is rolled the total is compared to a difficulty set by the GM. If the total is equal to or greater than the difficulty the action succeeds, and if the total is less than the difficulty the action fails.

When an Action Check is being referred to in text or in conversation by the GM the reference will take the following format: *Stat* (*Skill*) check.

For example, if a character is trying to sneak past an inattentive city guard by staying in the shadows the GM might say "Give me an Agility (Sneak) check", which is asking the player to roll an Action Check with their character's agility stat die, plus their sneak skill die, plus any relevant modifier dice or a d6 if they do not have any sneak modifiers.

Likewise, if a character is trying to sneak past a guard by blending in with a crowd of people, the GM might alternatively say "Give me a Social (Sneak) check" instead.

In this way, Action Checks are very flexible!

## Opposed Checks
The second kind of roll in the OGS is the Opposed Check. When the GM calls for an Opposed Check the player and the GM (or the two players) both make appropriate Action Checks, as adjudicated by the GM, and compare their totals. The participant with the higher total wins the Opposed Check. 

### Ties in an Opposed Check
It is possible for multiple participants to roll the same total, in which case the resulting tie is broken by comparing the following factors in-order: Individual die values from largest to smallest, individual die sizes from largest to smallest, and finally by repeatedly rolling opposed d12s to see who rolls highest.

*Example*: Imagine a player and the GM are making an opposed check. The player is rolling 2d6 + 1d8 for their check while the unimportant, unnamed NPC is rolling the standard 3d6. Both the player and the GM in this example roll a total of 11 resulting in a tie.

Because their totals are equal they tie and the GM compares their individual dice to determine how to break the tie. The NPC's highest roll is a 6, and the player's highest roll is also a 6. The NPC's next highest is a 4 and so is the player's, and it goes the same for their matching 1s. If they had not both rolled exactly the same the tie would have been broken in favor of whomever had the highest die in the earliest of the three comparisons.

Next the GM compares the die sizes. The NPC rolled 3d6 so all three dice have six sides. However, the player has a d8 for his first size comparison and so the tie is broken in the player's favor. The player wins the opposed check.

If one of the player's d8s had come up seven or eight, they would have won the tie breaker when the die values were compared. And if they had rolled a two instead of a one their total would have been 12; enough to beat the NPC's total by one.

## Open Rolls
The third kind of roll in the OGS is an Open Roll. This is just a term used to describe any roll that isn't a check and can be comprised of any combination of dice. All Open Rolls are simply totaled and the total value is used in some way directly. Rolling for damage after successfully attacking a target is an example of an open roll.

# Totals and Degrees of Success

Action can sometimes not just succeed. Sometimes a character rolls so well they succeed _and then some_. If an Action Check's total exceeds the target difficulty by two or more it is considered to be a critical success. Every additional two the difficulty is exceeded by adds another level of critical success. The multiple levels of critical success are referred to as "Stages". So, for example, if a character tried to attack a monster, and that attack had a difficulty of 8, and then the attacking character rolled a 16 you would say that the character got a "Four Stage Critical Success" or "Four Stage Critical Hit".

Contrary to critical success there is no such thing as a critical failure, no matter how low the total comes up, unless optional critical failure rules are used.

Actions generally determine the outcome of critical successes on a case by cause basis, if there are any effects at all. A Sneak skill check, for example, doesn't benefit from critical success. Attack rolls, on the other hand, benefit greatly with every stage adding another die to the damage roll.

# Flat Bonuses

The rarest kind of bonus in the OGS is the flat bonus. They are usually reserved for the effects of magic spells and magic items, and are extraordinarily powerful. In the case where a character with an applicable flat bonus rolls an Action Check or an Open Roll the flat bonus is added directly to the total.

# Increasing Die Sizes

Many modifiers increase die size including Enhancements and mystical effects. This effect is called a Die Increase and is represented in stages. A 1-Stage Die Increase increases a die one size, for example from d4 to d6. A 2-Stage Die Increase will increase a die two sizes, for example from d4 to d8.

Die Increase effects can normally only affect Action Checks, and will affect the enhancement die unless a different target is explicitly described in the effect description. In the rare instances where a Die Increase effect targets an open roll, *all* dice are increased. For example, if a 7th level Fireball spell that normally deals 10d6 points of fire damage is affected by a 2-Stage Die Increase effect, it will instead deal 10d10 points of fire damage.

If a Die Increase effect pushes a die above d12 the following occurs.

* If a die is affected, it becomes a dice pool
* The die pool defaults to [d8 + d6]
* Any further Die Increase effects from the same effect (example: a multi-stage Die Increase) target the d6
* If the d6 is increased past d12 the process repeats and the d12 is broken down into a pool worth [d8 + d6]
