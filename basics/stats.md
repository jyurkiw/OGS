# Character Statistics

Every character and monster in the OGS is defined by an array of statistics comprised of die codes. A d6 is considered to be "average" and starting stats will generally have one or two d4s and a like number of d8s.

The seven statistics of the OGS are as follows:

**Muscle** - A measure of a character's raw physical prowess  
**Coordination** - A measure of a character's physical coordination, and agility  
**Health** - A measure of a character's toughness, endurance, and resistance to damage  
**Knowledge** - A measure of a character's ability to learn  
**Acuity** - A measure of a character's ability to think  
**Personality** - A measure of a character's ability to socialize  
**Luck** - A measure of how much the universe loves the character

The standard statistics array used by new characters in the OGS is as follows: _d4, d6, d6, d6, d6, d8, d8_.

All players assign their character stats from that array in any configuration they desire.
