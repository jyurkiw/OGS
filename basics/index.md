**Dice Pool**: Used to refer to multiple dice rolled as a group and added together. If an effect states that it affects a die pool, it will only affect a single pool even if a roll consists of multiple pools.

**Die**: Used to refer to a single die. If an effect states that it affects a die it only affects a single die no matter how many dice are in the roll or the affected pool. Dice pools can be targeted by an effect that states it can target a die, in which case the effect's controller can pick which die in the pool is affected.

**Die Increase**: An effect that increases the size of a target die. Valid targets only include Action Checks and Enhancement Dice by default, but others may be specified in the effect description.
