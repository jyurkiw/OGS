# Hit Points

Hit Points are the measure of how much punishment both characters and their enemies can take before being disabled or killed. Both characters and enemies have hit point totals based on their class levels and their health stat.

## Calculating Hit Points

Hit Points are deterministic based on the dice chosen for a character or monster's health stat, and their class. To calculate a character's or monster's maximum hit points follow the following directions:

* Find the value of the character or monster's health die on the following table and multiply it by the character's or monster's level
* Find the value of the character's or monster's class's health die on the following table and multiply it by the character's level
* Add both values together

Hit Points By Die Size Table:

| Die |  Hit Points  |   Injured  |
|:---:|:------------:|:----------:|
| d4  |     2        |       3    |
| d6  |     3        |       4    |
| d8  |     4        |       6    |
| d10 |     5        |       8    |
| d12 |     6        |      10    |

## Optional Rule: Rolling Hit Points

Optionally, hit points may be rolled. Starting at level one, and every time a character reaches a new experience level, the character's health stat die and class health die are rolled and totaled and added to the character's current hit point total and hit point maximum.

# Taking Damage

Characters and monsters start with a number of hit points equal to their maximum hit points. When damage is taken from an attack, spell, trap, or hazard the damage total dealt is subtracted from the character or monster's current hit point total. A character's player should keep track of their character's current hit point total at all times while the GM should keep track of all monster hit point totals.

## Injured and Disabled

A character can take an amount of damage before becoming injured. When a character's current hit points is equal to or less than their class health die's injured value times their level they are considered to be Injured. An injured character applies a "drop 1 highest" modifier to all Action Checks and must drop the highest die roll before totaling their action dice.

If a character has a current hit point total less than or equal to zero they are no longer Injured and are considered Disabled. Disabled characters apply a "drop 2 highest" modifier to all Action Checks instead of the injured drop 1 highest, automatically fall prone unless they are receiving aid from another character or monster, can not move more than two meters per round, cannot cast spells, cannot attack, cannot take complex actions, and really cannot do much more than try their hardest to not die.

## Dying

If a disabled character takes damage they must immediately make a resistance check using just their health stat with a difficulty equal to the damage dealt. If the check passes the character remains disabled. If the check fails the character ceases to be disabled and instead becomes dying. Dying characters are effectively unconscious, cannot take actions, cannot move, and must check against death at the start of their turn or die.

## Death Checks

Dying characters must make death checks or die. Death checks are made with the character's health die against a base difficulty of 2 + the number of successful death checks made since their last full rest. Death checks must be made at the start of every character turn unless they have been stabilized by healing magic or an appropriate skill check.

Death checks must also be made immediately if a dying character takes damage with a difficulty equal to the damage dealt + the number of successful death checks made since their last full rest.

A character dies if a death check is failed.

# Recovering and Healing

## Healing

If healing is received from any source, the target immediately recovers the number of hit points healed unless the healing is otherwise blocked.

# Vitality Dice

All characters have a number of Vitality Dice based on their class and level. Almost all healing received must involve the expenditure of a vitality die. If a vitality die cannot be expended, the healing fails.

Whenever a full rest is completed, the character recovers half of their maximum vitality dice.

## Recovering From Injury

Recovering from the injured condition is as easy as raising a character's current points above their injured value times their level. This can be done through natural healing, the expenditure of vitality dice during a breather, or through magic.

## Recovering From the Disabled Condition

If disabled, recovery is more complicated than recovering from injury. If a disabled character received magical healing of any kind their current hit points cannot be increased above one unless the healing effect specifically states that it bypasses this limitation (only the most powerful healing effects do). This means that healing a disabled character requires at least two magical effects: An initial effect to increase current hit points from zero to one, and then additional healing to restore hit points above one.

If healing naturally, the disabled condition can only be removed during a full rest. As a part of the full rest the character can recover additional hit points by spending vitality dice as though taking a breather, but does not recover any vitality dice this full rest. Once the full rest is complete, the character may recover hit points by magical means as normal.

## Recovering From Death

Death can only be healed by powerful magic, and specific, powerful enhancements.

# Monsters, Injury, Disabled, and Death

Monsters handle hit point loss in a much simpler manner than characters. If a monster has taken any damage whatsoever it is considered to be injured for the purposes of maneuvers, spells, and anything else that requires the target be injured, however monsters never suffer from the injured condition's penalties.

Monsters are also never disabled and do not make death checks. A monster whose current hit points are reduced to zero immediately dies unless at least half of the damage taken by the monster is subdual in nature.
