# How to Play

Play is a simple three-step, repeating process.

1. The GM describes the environment.
2. Describe your actions to the GM.
3. The GM adjudicates the immediate consequences of your actions.
4. Repeat!

In step-1, the Game Master (GM) will describe to the players what environment their characters are currently in, and what is happening in that environment.

**Example**

*GM*: The swamp water smells of decay and clouds of mosquitoes buzz about your heads. Your small row boat serves well enough to navigate, but it's lack of speed
makes you uneasy as you cannot shake the feeling that you're being watched.

In step-2, the players tell the GM what they want their characters to do.

**Example**

*Michael*: If I'm feeling like something is watching us, I'm going to watch out for any kind of ambush. Can I make a Notice check of some kind?

*GM*: Yes you can! What about Laura? Do you want to do anything?

*Laura*: Well, since my character is a spellcaster, could she try and determine if this feeling of unease is mystical in nature? That merchant in the city *did*
swear vengeance on us, after all, and his son is a Mage.

*GM*: That's an idea! I know you have the Thaumaturgy skill, but I think I'm going to have you make this check with Lore (Occult) based on your knowledge stat.

In step-3, the GM then decides how to adjudicate the characters' actions using the game systems and their character stats.

**Example**

*GM*: Okay, we'll start with Laura's action because if Michael rolls well it could lead directly to combat. Laura, will you please roll Knowledge plus your Occult
skill plus any Occultism enhancements you have?

*Laura*: Lets see, my Knowledge stat is a d8, and my Occult skill is a d10. However I don't have any Occult enhancements, so the third die is just a d6. Right?

*GM*: That is correct! Go ahead and roll.

*Laura*: [*rolls dice*] I got a 5, 2, and 4. That's 11!

*GM*: 11 is only a little above average, but it's still not bad. You don't think anything mystical is to blame. It's just a creepy swamp filled with dangerous
predators.

*Laura*: Oh, that makes me feel *so much better*.

*Michael*: Is it my turn then?

*GM*: We are now on your action! Give me a roll of Acuity plus Notice plus any Notice enhancements.

*Michael*: Oh, Acuity. I'm so good at those! That's a d4 base, plus my d6 notice, plus my d4 enhancement because I'm blind in one eye!

*Laura*: HA! The intimidating eye-patch strikes again!

*Michael*: [*rolls dice*] That's a 3, 6 and 2! Not bad for a half-blind sell-sword, eh? 11!

*GM*: [*rolling dice*] You and your eye-patch see a massive dire swamp gator zero in on your little row boat. You remember something the old woman back at the
village saying something about the gods imparting the local predators with unnatural wisdom.

*Michael*: Uh oh! Looks like we've got company! I draw my sword!

*GM*: Okay you two, roll for initiative!

Then the process repeats! In the case of this example, the GM will describe the scenario of the combat with the giant aligator, the players will continue
to tell the GM what their characters will do given that information, and the GM will adjudicate the players' actions.
