# Skills
The skill die is the second of three dice rolled in every action check along with a stat die and an enhancement die. Skills are a measure of proficiency in a given area of training or knowledge and are awarded at regular intervals during play as a part of character progression.

Skills are grouped into collections based on use, defined by game and/or genre. Each skill is accompanied by a default skill die size that defines its complexity, as well as a list of commonly associated attributes.

## Skills and Stats
When an action check is called for, a skill die is rolled with a stat die and added to an enhancement die to get a total. Skills are not bound to a set stat, and instead can be used with any stat that the player or GM can justify. Every skill listing is accompanied by a list of stats commonly used with the skill. While almost any stat can be justified, the stats in the listing are the ones most routinely rolled with the skill.

## Skills and Complexity
Skills are defined in terms of complexity represented as a default die size: -, d4, or d6.

*Everyman*: Every adult in a setting is considered to be trained in all everyman skills. They default to a die size of d6.

*Simple*: Most skills are simple. Simple skills default to d4.

*Complex*: Using a skill improvement on a complex skill with a die size of - changes the skill's die size to d4. A complex skill with a die size of - cannot be used by a character under any circumstances. They simply do not have the training or the knowledge to effectively solve problems or discover information.

## Skill Advancement
All characters get a set number of skill improvements at character creation based on the specific game rules used.

As characters advance they will be regularly awarded skill improvements. Skill improvements can generally be assigned to any skill.
