# Lineages
A character's lineage is a record of where they come from. A character's lineage can be their race, species, nationality, or even their family.

A character's lineage generally gives a character a number of features that do not improve with level.

## Development (Target Balance)
A standard lineage in Fantasy Basics consists of a name, two minor features, one major feature. A 3rd or 4th minor feature may be added in exchange for one or two minor negative features or a major negative feature.

This target balance is arbitrary, and should function as long as all lineages target the same balance target.

### Development Definition: Minor Feature

A minor feature is the same level of power as a one stage increase to a skill or a damage die, or a melee action capable of dealing 1d4 damage.

Two minor features can be combined into a major feature.

### Development Definition: Major Feature

A major feature is the same level of power as a two stage increase to a skill, an add one and keep highest die enhancement to a skill, a melee action capable of dealing 1d8 damage, or a ranged action capable of dealing 1d6 damage at 15 feet.
