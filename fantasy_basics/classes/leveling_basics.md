## Skill Increases and Skill Max

A character of the indicated level has the listed number of die increases to skills. Skills start at 1d4 to 1d6 and each increase applied raises a skill by one up to the listed skill maximum.

Starting at level 9, a certain number of skills can be raised above the standard skill cap of d10 to d12 *or higher*.

## Features

At certain levels characters get certain features. The source of these features is typically the character's combat class (Warrior, Skirmisher, Priest, or Mage), social or skill class (Smith, Orator, Arborsmith, etc...), a character's epic class (Hero, Sword Saint, Prophet, Archmagus, etc...), or level (ability score increases).
